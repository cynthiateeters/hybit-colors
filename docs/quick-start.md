2. Replace [SUBTITLE] with "Create stunning visual effects with gradients"
3. Replace [BRIEF_DESCRIPTION] with "CSS gradients including linear, radial, conic, and advanced blending techniques"
4. Replace HAP's introduction with: "Gradients blew my mind when Prof. Teeters first demonstrated them - I thought they were image files! She showed me how CSS can create infinite gradient variations with just code: linear, radial, and even conic gradients. The best part? They're resolution-independent and load instantly. Let me show you the gradient magic!"

6. Add HAP's confession: "I spent hours writing Sass functions to lighten and darken colors, not knowing CSS was about to make it native! Prof. Teeters showed me color-mix() and I literally deleted half my preprocessor code. The embarrassing part? I was still using hex colors for everything when LCH provides perceptually uniform lightness - my 50% lighter calculations were all wrong!"

6. Add HAP's confession: "I used to hard-code colors everywhere - #007bff in 50 places! When the client wanted a slightly different blue, I had to find and replace all of them (and always missed some). Prof. Teeters introduced me to CSS custom properties and systematic naming. Now changing the entire color scheme takes seconds, not hours!"
7. Include CSS custom property systems, semantic naming, and theme switching examples
```

### Prompt 8: Update Easter Egg System

```
Please update data/hybit-insights.jsonc for the Colors theme using CONTENT-PLAN-FILLED.md easter egg section:

1. Replace the "allowedParams" array with:
   ["detail", "stations", "formats", "contrast", "harmony", "gradients", "modern", "systems"]

2. Update the "messages" object with these color-specific insights:
   - Keep "detail" and "stations" as they are
   - Replace "example1" through "example6" with:
     
   "formats": {
     "title": "🎨 HAP's Format Conversion Guide",
     "content": "Quick reference: HEX #RRGGBB → RGB rgb(R, G, B) → HSL hsl(H, S%, L%). Remember: RGB uses 0-255, HSL uses degrees (0-360) for hue, percentages for saturation/lightness. Prof. Teeters says HSL is best for creating variations!"
   },
   
   "contrast": {
     "title": "📊 HAP's Contrast Cheat Sheet",
     "content": "WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (18pt+). WCAG AAA: 7:1 for normal, 4.5:1 for large. Pro tip: Dark gray (#595959) on white barely passes AA, but #525252 is safe! Always test your combinations!"
   },
   
   "harmony": {
     "title": "🌈 HAP's Color Harmony Guide",
     "content": "Complementary = opposite (180°), Analogous = neighbors (±30°), Triadic = triangle (120° apart), Split-complementary = opposite + neighbors. Use HSL and just add to the hue value!"
   },
   
   "gradients": {
     "title": "🎨 HAP's Gradient Techniques",
     "content": "Avoid muddy midpoints by adding intermediate stops or using HSL! Conic gradients need 'from' for starting angle. Multiple backgrounds = mesh effects. Remember: gradients are images in CSS!"
   },
   
   "modern": {
     "title": "🚀 HAP's Modern CSS Support",
     "content": "color-mix(): 91% support, use @supports. Relative colors: 87% (Chrome/Safari). LAB/LCH: better for perceptual uniformity. OKLCH: best for gradients without muddy middles!"
   },
   
   "systems": {
     "title": "📦 HAP's Design System Template",
     "content": "Start with --primary, --secondary, --accent. Generate scales: 50 (lightest) to 900 (darkest). Use semantic names: --text-primary, --bg-secondary. Theme switching: data-theme attributes!"
   }

3. Update "pageHelp" for each station with color-specific suggestions from CONTENT-PLAN-FILLED.md
```

### Prompt 9: Validate and Test
