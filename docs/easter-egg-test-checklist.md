## Security verification checklist

After all functional tests pass, verify security improvements:

### Code review
- [ ] `js/easter-egg.js` no longer uses regex comment stripping
- [ ] `js/easter-egg.js` uses `response.json()` not `response.text()`
- [ ] File path changed from `.jsonc` to `.json`
- [ ] `data/hybit-insights.json` exists and is valid JSON
- [ ] `data/README.md` updated to reference `.json` file

### Security improvements verified
- [ ] No regex processing of user-influenced content
- [ ] Native JSON parsing (more secure)
- [ ] No comment-stripping bypass vulnerability
- [ ] Whitelist validation still in place (line 77 in easter-egg.js)
- [ ] No user input in innerHTML

---

## Browser compatibility testing

Test in multiple browsers (if available):

### Chrome/Edge
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No console errors

### Firefox
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No console errors

### Safari
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No console errors

## Performance check

**URL**: http://localhost:5500/stations/station3.html?hybit=color-wheel

**Measure**:
- [ ] Page loads in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Easter egg animation smooth (no jank)
- [ ] Dialog appears exactly 2 seconds after page load
- [ ] JSON file size reasonable (should be ~13KB)

**Result**: ‚òê PASS / ‚òê FAIL

---

## Cleanup checklist

After all tests pass:

- [ ] Delete old `data/hybit-insights.jsonc` file
- [ ] Commit changes with message: "Security fix: Convert JSONC to JSON for easter egg data"
- [ ] Update security audit report to mark Priority 1 as complete
- [ ] Deploy changes to production (if applicable)
